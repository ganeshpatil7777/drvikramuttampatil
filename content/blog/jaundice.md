Dr. Gajanan Rodge, a dedicated Gastroenterologist at Bombay Hospital, Specialist in Chronic Liver Disease Treatment. His expertise extends to General Gastroenterology, Interventional Endoscopy, Hepatology, and Gastrointestinal (GI) care, making him a trusted healthcare professional in Mumbai.

The liver is an organ about the size of a football. It sits just under your rib cage on the right side of your abdomen. The liver is essential for digesting food and ridding your body of toxic substances.

Liver disease can be inherited (genetic). Liver problems can also be caused by a variety of factors that damage the liver, such as viruses, alcohol use and obesity.

Over time, conditions that damage the liver can lead to scarring (cirrhosis), which can lead to liver failure, a life-threatening condition. But early treatment may give the liver time to heal.

Symptoms
Liver disease doesn't always cause noticeable signs and symptoms. If signs and symptoms of liver disease do occur, they may include:

Skin and eyes that appear yellowish (jaundice)
Abdominal pain and swelling
Swelling in the legs and ankles
Itchy skin
Dark urine color
Pale stool color
Chronic fatigue
Nausea or vomiting
Loss of appetite
Loss of appetite

Symptoms of jaundice commonly include:
Yellow skin and the white part of the eyes (sclera) -- when jaundice is more severe, these areas may look brown.
Yellow color inside the mouth.
Dark or brown-colored urine.
Pale or clay-colored stools.
Itching (pruritis) usually occurs with jaundice.
